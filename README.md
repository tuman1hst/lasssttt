A prototype dashboard interface that showcases a simple school dashboard.

## Installation

No build step is required. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust `API_URL` to point
to your backend. Open `dashboard.html` directly in your browser to load the front end.

## Usage

The page demonstrates a school dashboard layout powered by external CDN assets. It
expects an API at `API_URL` and includes a small connectivity check that calls the
`/status` endpoint.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue first to discuss any changes.

## Deployment Workflow

Suggested tooling for moving the dashboard from development to production:

1. **Coding & Version Control** – manage code with Git and host the repository on GitHub.
2. **Build & Test Automation** – run automated builds and checks via GitHub Actions.
3. **Automatic Deployment** – deploy the front end to Vercel and host the back end on DigitalOcean or AWS EC2 with Docker if needed.
4. **Database** – use a managed solution such as PlanetScale (serverless MySQL) or AWS RDS.
5. **Domain & SSL** – route traffic and secure HTTPS using Cloudflare.
6. **Monitoring & Logging** – track errors with Sentry and analyze user traffic through Google Analytics.
